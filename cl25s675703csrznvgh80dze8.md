## The Solidity Sagas- What will it be about?

The word 'Saga' comes from old Norse, and it basically stands for 'a long story or a long-drawn-out series of incidents'. 
I am a 4th-year CS undergrad, who is around 1 month into his web3 journey at the time of writing. Long story short, I feel there is still a need for content creators in the web3 space, and a blog dedicated to the most popular language in the field would be a good addition to the crowd. 

This will be a long-drawn-out journey for both you and me ( if you are a beginner like me), but I am sure that our sails will find a harbor if we row hard enough. 
I am going to start off the blog with a couple of posts on the most used data structures and the basic syntax of writing a '*Smart Contract*', the driving force behind a DAPP. 

I have worked with different coding languages in the past, and I feel diving right in is the best way to do it. As such, I will guide you through learning the language as I wish I had done when I started. 

I am by now means an expert, but I will try my best to be clear and thorough in the concepts I write about, and I hope we can both learn something via this blog.

*This blog is targeted toward people who have previous experience with programming but are just starting out with solidity.* 

I don't know if this blog pans out or not, but we can only ever try.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to what will hopefully be a long-term, well-written blog that provides value to its readers.
